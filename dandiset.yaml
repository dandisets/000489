description: Cells were electroporated by a train of 5 unipolar 600 ns pulses (0 percent)
  or bipolar 600 + 600 ns pulses (25, 50, 75, 100 percent) at 1 Hz. 25, 50, 75, and
  100% represent the second pulse's amplitude in relation to the first pulse's amplitude.
  0% represents a unipolar pulse, where no second pulse was applied. Supported by
